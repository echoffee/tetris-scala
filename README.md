# tetris-scala

A tetris game written in scala using scalafx.

## Running

Clone the project, compile and run `Drawer` with `sbt`.

## Controls

+ `Left Arrow / Right Arrow` : Move the block left or right
+ `Up Arrow / X` : Turn the block clockwise
+ `W` : Turn the block counter-clockwise
+ `Space` : Hard drop
+ `Down Arrow` : Fast drop (somehow, spam it lol)


No game over event, scoring or SRS mechanisms yet. Maybe one day.
